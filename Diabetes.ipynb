The elevated insulin level warrants further investigation.\n",

Limit added sugars to less than 25 grams per day. Aim for 45-60 grams of carbohydrates per meal, adjusting based on activity level and individual response.\n",
            "    *   **Protein:** Include lean protein sources such as chicken, fish, beans, lentils, and tofu in each meal. Aim for 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.\n",

            "*   **Incorporate strength training exercises at least 2 days per week.** Focus on all major muscle groups (legs, arms, back, chest, shoulders, and abdomen). Use weights, resistance bands, or bodyweight exercises.\n",
            "*   **Increase daily physical activity.** Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk during lunch breaks, and park further away from destinations. Aim for at least 10,000 steps per day.\n",
